This is my patch queue for the bitcoinj project 
(hosted at Google Code in Subversion)

BitCoinJ implements the native BitCoin P2P protocol in Java.

There are two branches:

   * "master" tracks the official subversion repository 
   * "thilo" contains my patches
   

Everything that I commit under the "thilo" branch is to be considered
a "Contribution submitted to Google" in the context of the
Google Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement").

This does not include other branches or code from contributors
other than myself, unless otherwise indicated.
